# Temtem NPC Map 
Temtem NPC map is a fan-made map for the game [Temtem](https://crema.gg/games/temtem/). In Temtem patch 0.6.12, the game introduced a **Postal Service** mechanic in which the player is given 1-3 parcels and tasked with delivering them to NPCs all over the game world! The goal of this interactive map is to make it a little easier to find these NPCs.

This site is in no way an official Temtem or Crema website. All images, styles, and design choices are inspired by and/or belong to Crema.

## Notice
Currently, this website only displays Kisiwa. Other islands still need to be mapped and set up with their own coordinate systems. The idea is to get the functionality working for this island, and then start filling in the others. This website is maintained in its entirety by one person, so please have patience. Hopefully the rest will be coming soon!
